## Requirements

To set up this component, you will need MongoDB installed on your machine. Once you have MongoDB installed, you can install the project's dependencies.

## Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```
npm install
```

## Getting Started

After that, you can create and seed the database by running:
```
npm run seed
```

Next you can bundle your project's files using webpack by running:
```
npm run build
```

After your bundle.js file is created, you will need to create a .env file that specifies the host name and port for this app using the variables PORT and HOST.

When you are ready to start the app, turn on the server by running:
```
npm start
```
